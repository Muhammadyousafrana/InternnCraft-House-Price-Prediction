Project Submission Guidelines
1. Time Management
• Ensure you adhere strictly to the deadlines. Timeliness is crucial.
2. Proper Documentation
• Along with your project submission, prepare and submit proper documentation 
detailing your project. This documentation should include:
o Project Overview: A brief description of your project.
o Objectives: The main goals and objectives of your project.
o Methodology: The approach and methods you used to complete the 
project.
o Challenges: Any challenges or hurdles you faced and how you overcame 
them.
o Conclusion: The final outcome and any recommendations or future 
steps.
3. Originality
• Your project must be original and not copied from any source. Plagiarism will 
result in the cancellation of your project submission.
Note

House Price Analysis and Prediction
Objective: Analyze a dataset of house prices to understand pricing factors, identify
outliers, and develop a model for future price prediction.
Tasks:
1. Data Cleaning and Exploration:
o Clean the data: Identify and handle missing values, inconsistencies,
and outliers.
o Explore the data: Analyze the distribution of house prices and other
features. Identify potential relationships between features and price
using visualizations (scatter plots, box plots, etc.).
2. Feature Engineering:
o Create new features that might be relevant for price prediction (e.g.,
age of the house, number of bedrooms per floor).
o Consider encoding categorical features (e.g., location) into numerical
values suitable for modeling.
3. Outlier Analysis:
o Identify houses with significantly higher or lower prices compared to
similar properties.
o Investigate the reasons for these outliers. Are there any specific
features or combinations of features that contribute to the outliers?
4. Predictive Modeling:
o Train a machine learning model to predict house prices based on the
available features. Popular choices for this task include linear
regression, random forest, or gradient boosting.
o Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics (e.g.,
mean squared error, R-squared).
5. Future Price Prediction:
o Use the trained model to predict future house prices based on
hypothetical scenarios (e.g., what would be the price of a house with
specific characteristics in a particular location?).
6. Report and Recommendations:
o Prepare a report summarizing your findings, including:
▪ Data exploration results (key insights from visualizations)
▪ Feature engineering techniques used
▪ Outlier analysis (identification and explanation)
▪ Model selection and evaluation results
▪ Future price prediction examples
▪ Recommendations for further analysis or data collection (if
applicable)
Deliverables:
• A well-documented script containing your data cleaning, exploration, feature
engineering, modeling, and prediction code.
• A clear and concise report summarizing your findings and recommendations.
Evaluation:
• Your work will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
o Completeness of tasks
o Data analysis skills (cleaning, exploration, visualization)
o Understanding of feature engineering concepts
o Ability to build and evaluate a machine learning model
o Quality and clarity of reporting
